# Parrot-OS-setup
Made this script during setup on parrot os and switching from Kali -> Parrot
Easy script to run

Command to start:sudo bash Parrot-OS.sh

MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT THE INSTALLED ITEMS on the script, I have a config for me and a config for other people you could choice 1 for my config or 2 for a basic config thats hard not to like.
please make changes it cant make a script for everyones needs and as always give suggestions and errors.
